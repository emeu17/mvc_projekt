    <p>These pages were coded during the course MVC in the spring of 2021.
        The project consists of PHP code in the Symfony framework, using
        Doctrine as ORM to connect to a MySQL database on the student server.</p>

    <p>Play the game twenty one found through the navbar above. Or check out my
        library under the books-link.</p>
